Description: Provides functions for calculating deviation in vector
    variable datasets. Contains functions for converting data from rasters
    into tables for deviation functions. Also contains functions for 
    converting meteorological wind datasets of u and v components into 
    vector variables tables for use in deviation functions. All vector 
    deviation functions are based on the work of Robert G. Pontius.
